            <h1>LINDSAY'S NOTES</h1>
            <P>How it happened is that I asked my sister Steph what she’s been making for dinner lately, and she said, “I make that salmon recipe but I just use a can of chickpeas instead to keep it easy.” And now, if you ask me what I’m making for dinner lately, I’m going to say the exact same thing because okay wow that is very delicious and it only takes ten minutes.</P>
            <p> STEPH FOR PRESIDENT!</p>
            <p>This chickpea curry is, well, it’s everything. It’s cozy, it’s pantry-friendly, and maybe even a little elegant? *hair toss* even though it’s super super easy? It’s comforting without being heavy, nutritious without being boring, and beautiful without being high maintenance.</p>
            <p>I came into this realization too late to include it in the photos here, but serving this with a little side of pickled cucumber salad (sliced cucumbers, sliced red onion, white vinegar, olive oil, salt, and sugar) is *chef’s kiss* SOS perfection.</p>
            <p>With or without the cucumber salad, I can definitely say that swooping the wooden spoon leisurely through that luscious sauce, piling the saucy goodness of chickpeas and spinach over steaming rice, and then drizzling the chili crisp <em>(affiliate link)</em> over the whole thing… it’s definitely a living-my-best-life type moment.</p>

                <li>Cook rice according to package directions.</li>
                <li>Heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and curry paste; sauté until softened and fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the brown sugar, coconut milk, and soy sauce. Bring to a low simmer until thickened slightly.</li>
                <li>Add chickpeas, spinach, and cilantro; cook until chickpeas are heated through and spinach is wilted. Mash the chickpeas ever so slightly with the back of a wooden spoon if you want to change up the texture and make it more creamy.</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust to your liking – we often add a squeeze of lime or some extra ginger or lemongrass, but it’s really not necessary. The flavor is totally there even with the most basic ingredient list. Serve over rice with a dollop of chili crisp (affiliate link) and a side of pickled cucumber salad if you want (and I promise you do want this – see notes). Top with more cilantro, if you want! </li>
